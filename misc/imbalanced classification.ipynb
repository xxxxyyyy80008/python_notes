    "*The authors of the paper concludes that:*\n",
    "\n",
    "> Null bias is also shown by two metrics directly depending on *SNS and SPC*: **geometric mean (GM) and bookmaker informedness (BM or single-threshold AUC)**. These solve the one-dimensionality problem of the SNS and SPC metrics by considering either their arithmetic (BM) or geometric (GM) mean. Although these two metrics constitute good alternatives to be used with imbalanced datasets, they have the drawback of **focusing on only the classification successes (λPP and λNN)**, and fail to directly consider the classification errors (λPN and λNP).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The second best (lowest biased) cluster of metrics is that which is comprised of accuracy (ACC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and markedness (MK). These all have a global (not partial) perspective, since classification results on both positive and negative classes are considered. From among these 3 metrics, ACC focuses only on the classification successes, which is a drawback and, additionally, has the highest bias (except when extreme balanced datasets are used). In this cluster, the lowest bias is shown by MCC with moderate values (lower than 0.2 in the normalized version) for almost every value of the imbalance coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Finally, the metrics in the third and fourth clusters, precision (PRC), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 score (F1), are highly biased and should be avoided for use in imbalanced datasets. Table 14 summarizes the behaviour of performance metrics with imbalanced datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Yes, your assumptions about Kappa seem about right. Kappa as single, scalar metrics is mostly and advantage over other single, scalar metrics like accuracy, which will not reflect prediction performance of smaller classes (shadowed by performance of any much bigger class). Kappa solves this problem more elegantly, as you pointed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Using a metric like Kappa to measure your performance will not necessarily increase how your model fits to the data.** You could measure the performance of any model using a number of metrics, but how the model fits data is determined using other parameters (e.g. hyperparameters). So you might use e.g. Kappa for selecting a best suited model type and hyperparametrization amongst multiple choices for your very imbalanced problem - but just computing Kappa itself will not change how your model fits your imbalanced data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For different metrics: besides Kappa and precision/recall, also take a look at true positive and true negative rates TPR/TNR, and ROC curves and the area under curve AUC. Which of those are useful for your problem will mostly depend on the details of your goal. For example, the different information reflected in TPR/TNR and precision/recall: is your goal to have a high share of frauds actually being detected as such, and a high share of legitimate transactions being detected as such, and/or minimizing the share of false alarms (which you will naturally get \"en mass\" with such problems) in all alarms?\n",
    "\n",
    "> For up-/downsampling: I think there is no canonical answer to \"if those are required\". They are more one way of adapting your problem. Technically: yes, you could use them, but use them with care, especially upsampling (you might end up creating unrealistic samples without noticing it) - and be aware that changing the frequency of samples of both classes to something not realistic \"in the wild\" might have negative effects on prediction performance as well. **At least the final, held-out test set should reflect the real-life frequency of samples again.** Bottom line: I've seen both cases where doing and not doing up-/or downsampling resulted in the better final outcomes, so this is something you might need to try out (but don't manipulate your test set(s)!).\n",

    "- This <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04592.pdf> paper </a> introduced something I haven't seen in many literatures. \n",
    "- on this github <a href=https://github.com/ZhaoRichard/nproc> link </a>, the author stated the following:\n",
    "> In many binary classification applications, such as disease diagnosis and spam detection, practitioners commonly face the need to **limit type I error** (i.e., the conditional probability of misclassifying a class 0 observation as class 1) so that it remains below a desired threshold. To address this need, the Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification paradigm is a natural choice; **it minimizes type II error(i.e., the conditional probability of misclassifying a class 1 observation as class 0) while enforcing an upper bound, alpha, on the type I error.** Although the NP paradigm has a century-long history in hypothesis testing, it has not been well recognized and implemented in classification schemes. Common practices that directly limit the empirical type I error to no more than alpha do not satisfy the type I error control objective because the resulting classifiers are still likely to have type I errors much larger than alpha. As a result, the NP paradigm has not been properly implemented for many classification scenarios in practice. In this work, we develop the first umbrella algorithm that implements the NP paradigm for all scoring-type classification methods, including popular methods such as logistic regression, support vector machines and random forests. Powered by this umbrella algorithm, we propose a novel graphical tool for NP classification methods: NP receiver operating characteristic (NP-ROC) bands, motivated by the popular receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. NP-ROC bands will help choose in a data adaptive way and compare different NP classifiers.\n",
